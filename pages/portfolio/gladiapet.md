For the 3 people that don‚Äôt know, Telegram is a messaging platform that is used for personal and group communications, large-scale community building, content sharing, and more. The app is one of the world‚Äôs fastest-growing and largest social messaging platforms. The company is managing 900 million monthly active users, and 69 million in revenue and the CEO Pavel is still the sole Product Manager at the company with only 30 people (29 now that he is in jail hehe).

Well, that‚Äôs what we call a Product Market Fit.

Compared to classic social media giants, Telegram stands out for its endorsement of values aligned with crypto principles. This reputation is built on its stance against censorship of any kind within the app and its policy of not sharing user data with governments. While you can [legitimately doubt](https://x.com/zooko/status/1827806006438703416) their motivations to follow these values, we have to admit that Telegram‚Äôs approach on building it‚Äôs app and ecosystem is akin to a blockchain network in several ways:

1. **Open and free APIs**: Telegram‚Äôs free open APIs enable developers to create custom bots and applications, fostering a diverse ecosystem of third-party services.
2. **Stickers and Customization**: Users can create and share personalized sticker packs, promoting creativity without central control.
3. **Client Diversification**: As an open-source platform, Telegram allows independent developers to build alternative clients, encouraging community-driven innovation.

Last but not least, Telegram launched the TON blockchain a Layer 1 network originally designed by Telegram and extensively within the Telegram app ecosystem.

With this massive distribution, crypto ethos and infrastructure. Telegram is the most well positioned actor I‚Äôm aware of to finally bring the ‚ÄúnExT billOn UsErS‚Äù we were talking about for the last 5 years. The growing popularity of Telegram's web3 mini-games, such as Hamster Kombat and Catizen, reflects the TON blockchain adoption. These games attracted [up to 31 millions daily active users](https://x.com/hamster_kombat/status/1797677280589947204) by offering straightforward gameplay experiences (mostly clickers) that allow players to participate in a gamified airdrop farming competition. This kind of opportunity is typically reserved for the most knowledgeable web3 users, who already have a non-custodial crypto wallet and funds to risk. While there may be skepticism about the accuracy of some metrics and the obvious role of airdrops in these games' success. They have successfully attracted millions of users outside the Ethereum ecosystem, which suggests there's something valuable to learn from them rather than simply dismissing them with bot-activity skepticism.

## Gladiapet: Bringing Ethereum to Telegram

The Ethereum ecosystem can be described as "too big to be small and too small to be big," where entrepreneurs focus on achieving relative success within the existing framework without exploring how to expand the current pretty small user base. Bringing Ethereum to Telegram presents a unique opportunity to expand its reach and address some of its limitations. Many integrations of the TON blockchain within Telegram uses its open API, highlighting Telegram's potential as a platform for blockchain experiences across various blockchain ecosystems, not just TON.

Integrating Ethereum with Telegram could improve the web3 experience for users by offering:

- **Secure and User-Friendly Self-Custody**: Enabled by Account Abstraction.
- **Decentralization and Censorship Resistance**: Provided by Ethereum's robust security.
- **Low Fees**: Achieved through Ethereum Layer 2 solutions.

**_Well what is preventing you to do it ?_**

Nothing‚Ä¶ So we just did it.

I'm excited to introduce Gladiapet, a hyper-casual game for Telegram on Ethereum. In Gladiapet you can collect, train and battle with your gladiator NFT pet. This game serves as an experiment for us to explore the frontiers of web3 gaming, including its economics, technology, distribution, and marketing. I'll be sharing our insights, challenges, and decisions along the way directly on X.

Stay tuned üëÄ
