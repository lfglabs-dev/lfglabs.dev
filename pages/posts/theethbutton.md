The Ethereum Button is a gamified engagement experiment inspired by game theory principles. It was designed to attract Ethereum users to the Starknet network through an innovative giveaway game. Here's how it works:

1. Players compete to be the last person to press a virtual button before a countdown reaches zero.
2. Each button press requires one credit.
3. Players earn credits through on-chain activity on Ethereum or Starknet.
4. The game continues until the countdown expires, determining the winner.
5. The winner gets 5 ETH.
